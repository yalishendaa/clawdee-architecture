# Files Reference -- Complete Map

Every file in the agent workspace, its role, who fills it, when it loads, and access rules.

## Legend

- **Loads:** `always` = every session start, `on-demand` = Read tool / Skill tool, `never` = not loaded
- **Writer:** who creates/updates the file
- **Access:** who can read/modify

---

## Layer 1: Global (`~/.claude/`)

Shared across ALL agents on this machine. Loaded every session.

| File | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Global rules, code conventions, git policy, project paths | always | operator (manual) | all agents read, only operator edits |
| **rules/bash.md** | Bash coding standards: `set -euo pipefail`, quoting | always | operator (manual) | all agents read, only operator edits |
| **rules/python.md** | Python standards: type hints, pathlib, Google docstrings | always | operator (manual) | all agents read, only operator edits |
| **rules/typescript.md** | TS standards: strict, no any, Zod, interfaces | always | operator (manual) | all agents read, only operator edits |

**Who can touch:** Only the operator. Agents NEVER modify global files.

---

## Layer 2: Identity (`{workspace}/.claude/`)

Per-agent identity. Loaded every session via `@include` directives in CLAUDE.md.

| File | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | SOUL -- agent character, personality, principles, priorities, workflow rules. Contains `@include` directives that pull in other files | always | operator (manual) | agent reads, only operator edits |
| **core/AGENTS.md** | Operating rules: models, message bus paths, subagent config, cross-review rules, pipelines, analytics | on-demand (Read tool) | operator (manual) | agent reads, only operator edits |
| **core/USER.md** | Operator profile: name, timezone, channels, products, communication style | always (@include) | operator + agent (YELLOW) | agent updates with justification as operator evolves |
| **core/rules.md** | Boundaries: what agent can/cannot do, red zones, security, git policy, Telegram rules | always (@include) | operator (manual) | agent reads, only operator edits |
| **tools/TOOLS.md** | Infrastructure map: servers, SSH, Docker, systemd, ports, GitHub, secrets paths | on-demand (Read tool) | operator (manual) or agent with permission | agent reads, agent can suggest edits |

**Note:** AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md are NOT included at startup to save tokens (~18KB). Agents load them on-demand via Read tool when needed.

**Who can touch:** Operator only. These are the agent's constitution -- agent cannot self-modify identity.

---

## Layer 3: Memory -- WARM (`core/warm/`)

Rolling 14-day memory. Auto-compressed. Loaded every session.

| File | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **warm/decisions.md** | Recent architectural/operational decisions. Topic-based key facts, auto-compressed by Sonnet | always (@include) | **trim-hot.sh** (cron, appends summaries from HOT), **compress-warm.sh** (cron, re-compresses), agent (during session for important decisions) | agent reads, cron writes, operator can edit |

**Lifecycle:**
1. `trim-hot.sh` (05:00 UTC) extracts old HOT entries -> appends to WARM as `## YYYY-MM-DD (auto-compressed)` sections
2. `compress-warm.sh` (06:00 UTC) re-compresses WARM if >10KB using Sonnet -> topic-based key facts
3. `rotate-warm.sh` (04:30 UTC) moves entries >14 days to COLD (MEMORY.md)
4. Agent can write important decisions during session

**Who can touch:** Cron scripts (automated), agent (append only), operator (full access).

---

## Layer 4: Memory -- HOT (`core/hot/`)

Rolling 24h journal. Every conversation turn recorded. Loaded every session.

| File | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **hot/handoff.md** | Compact extract from recent.md: last 10 conversation entries. Injected at session start for continuity without loading the full journal | always (@include) | **hook** (extracts last 10 from recent.md at session start) | agent reads, hook writes |
| **hot/recent.md** | Full conversation journal: timestamp, source tag, user snippet (200 chars), agent snippet (200 chars). Emergency trim at 20KB/600 lines | on-demand (Read tool) | **gateway.py** (`append_to_hot_memory()` with fcntl lock), **trim-hot.sh** (cron, compresses old entries) | agent reads, gateway writes, cron trims |

**Entry format:**
```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [source_tag]
**Принц:** user message snippet (200 chars max)
**Agent:** agent response snippet (200 chars max)
```

**Source tags:** `own_text`, `own_voice`, `forwarded`, `external_media`

**Who can touch:** Gateway (append via fcntl lock), cron (trim/compress), agent (read only). Operator can edit.

---

## Layer 5: Memory -- COLD (`core/`)

Archive. NOT loaded into session context. Accessed via Read tool when needed.

| File | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **MEMORY.md** | Permanent archive of decisions rotated from WARM (>14 days). May contain months of history | on-demand (Read tool) | **rotate-warm.sh** (cron, appends old WARM entries), **memory-rotate.sh** (cron, archives to monthly files) | agent reads on-demand, cron writes |
| **LEARNINGS.md** | Lessons from mistakes: context, what went wrong, correct approach, rule | on-demand (Read tool) | agent (during session when learning occurs) | agent reads/writes, operator reads |
| **archive/*.md** | Monthly archives (`2026-04.md`, `2026-03.md`). MEMORY.md archived here when >5KB | never (manual Read) | **memory-rotate.sh** (cron) | read-only archive |

**Who can touch:** Cron scripts (automated archival), agent (append learnings), operator (full access).

---

## Layer 6: Semantic Memory -- OpenViking (L4)

External semantic database. NOT a file. Accessed via HTTP API.

| Resource | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|----------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **viking://user/{agent}/memories/*** | Extracted semantic facts from conversations. LLM-powered extraction of preferences, decisions, entities | on-demand (curl) | **gateway.py** (`push_to_openviking()` in background thread) | agent searches via curl, gateway writes |

**Anti-pollution guards:**
- `forwarded` messages -> "Do NOT extract as operator's own preferences"
- `external_media` -> "Not operator's own words"
- `own_text`/`own_voice` -> no guard (operator's direct words)

**Who can touch:** Gateway (write via API), agent (search via curl), OpenViking service (manages storage).

---

## Layer 7: Skills (`skills/`)

Callable skills. NOT loaded at session start. Loaded on-demand when Skill tool invoked.

| Path | Role | Loads | Writer | Access |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **skills/{name}/SKILL.md** | Skill definition: frontmatter (description, triggers), instructions, `$ARGUMENTS` | on-demand (Skill tool) | developer (manual) | agent reads when skill called |
| **skills/{name}/*.sh** | Shell scripts used by skill | on-demand (skill execution) | developer (manual) | agent executes |
| **skills/{name}/*.py** | Python scripts used by skill | on-demand (skill execution) | developer (manual) | agent executes |

**Example skills:** groq-voice, superpowers, gws, youtube-transcript, twitter, quick-reminders, markdown-new, excalidraw, datawrapper, perplexity-research

**Who can touch:** Developer/operator creates skills. Agent can use but not modify.

---

## Layer 8: Subagent Definitions (`agents/`)

**Who can touch:** Operator only. Agent NEVER reads content, NEVER copies between servers, NEVER commits, NEVER outputs to stdout/stderr.

---

## Layer 11: Gateway (`shared/gateway/`)

Telegram router. Shared across agents. NOT loaded into agent context.

| File | Role | Writer | Access |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| **gateway.py** | Main router: Telegram polling -> Claude subprocess -> response -> memory | developer | developer edits, systemd runs |

**Key rule:** Each agent's workspace is **private**. Other agents CANNOT read another agent's core/, hot/, warm/, MEMORY.md, LEARNINGS.md without explicit operator permission.
